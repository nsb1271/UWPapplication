# Authenticating to GitHub

Add your GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise account information to GitHub Desktop so you can access your repositories.

Before you authenticate, you must already have a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account.

- For more information on creating a GitHub account, see "[Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)".
- For a GitHub Enterprise account, contact your GitHub Enterprise site administrator.

> **Note:** If your organization is on the [Business plan](https://help.github.com/articles/organization-billing-plans) and has enabled SAML single sign-on, you must create and authorize a personal access token to access protected content. For more information on creating personal access tokens, see "[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). For more information on authenticating with SAML single sign-on, see "[About authentication with SAML single sign-on](https://help.github.com/articles/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on)."
